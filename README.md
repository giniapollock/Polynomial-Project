# Polynomial-Project

Demonstrates an understanding of the Linked List data type, nodes, and their functionality. It is essentially a component of a Mathematics solving software. 

# Node class
The Node class represents an individual term of a polynomial. Contains data representing the Polynomial, and a link to the next Node object in the chain. The chain is singly-linked, with each node pointing to the next node.

# Functionality
Program assumes all powers and coefficients are integers, all polynomials represent a function of x, and that all polynomials are input in decending order (ex: "4x2 + 2x + 3")
