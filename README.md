# Polynomial-Project
CIS 2353 Data Structures Project 2

Taken directly from the project requirements: 

For this assignment, you will create a class named Polynomial, and a class named Node. Each Polynomial object will be responsible for maintaining a chain of linked nodes. You can assume the polynomial is in standard, decreasing term form. For example, a polynomial will always be read from file in the correct order, and constructed as for example, 4x2 + 2x + 3 and not something like 2x + 3 + 4x2.

Assume all polynomials represent a function of x, and no other mathematical variables. In other words, x will be the only character encountered representing a mathematical variable.
